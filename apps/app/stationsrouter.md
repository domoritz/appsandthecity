description: A* routing to find your way around a station

---

Here is a simple example of A* routing for a graph model of a station to be able to find your way from one part of the station to the other: https://gist.github.com/4172489

To be done:

* Better A* representation
* Special graph weights for road crossing, stairs, escalators and elevators
* See if using a cartesian grid search (instead of a graph search) using the GPS coordinates is easier and yields more accuracy
